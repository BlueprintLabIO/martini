# Migration Guide (v1 to v2)

A full migration guide is coming soon. It will cover breaking changes, new APIs, and recommended upgrade steps when moving from martini-kit v1 to v2.

In the meantime:
- Review release notes in the [Changelog](/docs/latest/changelog).
- Check package READMEs for version-specific notes.

If you encounter specific migration issues, open a discussion or issue and we'll incorporate the details here.
