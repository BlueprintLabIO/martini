# Build Your First Game

In this tutorial, we will build a complete multiplayer game from scratch. We'll create a simple "Paddle Battle" game (like Pong) where two players compete against each other.

## What You Will Learn

- Setting up a martini-kit project
- Creating a game state and actions
- Integrating with Phaser for rendering
- Handling player input and physics
- Testing with multiple clients

2. [Gameplay Logic](/docs/latest/getting-started/first-game/02-gameplay) - Implement the core game loop and mechanics
3. [Finishing Touches](/docs/latest/getting-started/first-game/03-finishing) - Add polish and scoring
