# PhysicsManager

This page is a placeholder for the upcoming PhysicsManager API docs. PhysicsManager will provide higher-level helpers for configuring Phaser physics profiles across your scenes.

In the meantime:
- Use [Physics Sync](./physics-sync) for synchronizing physics state between host and clients.
- See [Phaser Helpers](./helpers) for other utilities available today.

Once the API is finalized, this page will include usage examples and configuration options.
