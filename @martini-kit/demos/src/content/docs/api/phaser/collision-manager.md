# CollisionManager

Documentation for CollisionManager is coming soon. This helper will provide higher-level collision setup utilities for Phaser scenes.

Until then:
- Review [Physics Sync](./physics-sync) for keeping physics state in sync.
- Check [Phaser Helpers](./helpers) for currently available utilities.

Links will be updated when the API is finalized.
