# StateDrivenSpawner

Documentation for StateDrivenSpawner is coming soon. This helper will simplify spawning and syncing collections (bullets, enemies, etc.) from state arrays.

For now:
- Use [SpriteManager](./sprite-manager) to manage sprite lifecycles.
- See [Phaser Helpers](./helpers) for other available utilities.
