ok let's dive into implementing the app, but first, I want you to identify industry gold standard helper libraries such as tasnstack query and other similar libraries that can really help with our implementation. first read /specs and also break down the best practices for a platform like this. in other words, lets dive into the lower abstraction level design stage and make some key decisions. just ask me clarifying questions. do not code

just implement one new planned feature I can manually try out at a time, explain the scope and get me to confirm. the project already has some features implemented.
