ok let's dive into implementing the app, but first, I want you to identify industry gold standard helper libraries such as tasnstack query and other similar libraries that can really help with our implementation. first read /specs and also break down the best practices for a platform like this. in other words, lets dive into the lower abstraction level design stage and make some key decisions. just ask me clarifying questions. do not code

just implement one new planned feature I can manually try out at a time, explain the scope and get me to confirm. the project already has some features implemented.


in wuick mode the code editor does not update even though the 
ai chat shows File Updated. In Safe Mode it works fine.

we need a multi-modla ai to handle assets

we want some way for Game Error
can't access property "y", this.player is undefined to automatically
be handled by the API

well if we constantly get these bugs, maybe we should just break
the files down into smaller files or use some patterns to guarantee 
correctness. can you think of any ways to do this?
