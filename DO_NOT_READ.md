ok let's dive into implementing the app, but first, I want you to identify industry gold standard helper libraries such as tasnstack query and other similar libraries that can really help with our implementation. first read /specs and also break down the best practices for a platform like this. in other words, lets dive into the lower abstraction level design stage and make some key decisions. just ask me clarifying questions. do not code

just implement one new planned feature I can manually try out at a time, explain the scope and get me to confirm. the project already has some features implemented.



we need a multi-modla ai to handle assets


chat images are stored in a public bucket, probs need to change
this later for security


ok given that the demo architecture in packages/@martini/demos is quite clean, how
can we use it to inform our general web app. also it uses typescript, can we use tooling
like vite or typescript compilers or biome/eslint/prettier to help the human and ai
to achieve things like HMR and compile time safety when they are creating their phaser
games? how well can we use martini in the general web app under apps/web?
