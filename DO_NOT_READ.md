ok let's dive into implementing the app, but first, I want you to identify industry gold standard helper libraries such as tasnstack query and other similar libraries that can really help with our implementation. first read /specs and also break down the best practices for a platform like this. in other words, lets dive into the lower abstraction level design stage and make some key decisions. just ask me clarifying questions. do not code

just implement one new planned feature I can manually try out at a time, explain the scope and get me to confirm. the project already has some features implemented.


ok the game is kind of working. there are some bugs, for instance, on one screen it's just two red, and on another its just two blue players. 

Game Error
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setVelocity')

My main player can enter the game fine, but the client shows this: "Game Error
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setVelocity')" which is annoying


the lava is not placed correctly, screenshot and fix

we need a multi-modla ai to handle assets


ok great, can you impport it in the sveltekit web app and implement it?  completely purge the old system. remember to update the prompts for the AI so it can use this new API effectively. 


chat images are stored in a public bucket, probs need to change
